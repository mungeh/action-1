GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.
Key components of GitHub Actions:
1. **Workflows**: Automated procedures that you add to your repository. Defined by a YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory. A repository can have multiple workflows.
2. **Events**: Specific activities that trigger a workflow run. For example, a push to a branch, a pull request, creating an issue, or on a schedule.
3. **Jobs**: A set of steps that execute on the same runner. Each job runs in its own virtual machine (VM) or container. Jobs can run in parallel or sequentially (if one job depends on another).
4. **Steps**: Individual tasks that can run commands (shell commands, etc.) or actions. Steps are executed in order and are dependent on the previous step completing successfully.
5. **Actions**: Standalone commands that are combined into steps to create a job. You can create your own actions or use actions shared by the community.
6. **Runners**: Servers that run your workflows when they're triggered. GitHub provides hosted runners (Linux, Windows, macOS) or you can host your own.
A typical workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/build.yml`) looks like:
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push] # Trigger on push events
jobs:
  build: # Job ID
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Runner environment
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Action to checkout your repository
    - name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, world!
    - name: Run a multi-line script
      run: |
        echo Add other actions to build,
        echo test, and deploy your project.
```
Let's break down:
- `name`: The name of the workflow (appears in the Actions tab).
- `on`: Specifies the event that triggers the workflow. Here, it's triggered on every push.
- `jobs`: Contains one or more jobs. Here, we have one job called `build`.
- `runs-on`: Specifies the type of runner (here, the latest Ubuntu).
- `steps`: A sequence of steps in the job.
  - `uses`: Specifies an action to use. The `actions/checkout` action checks out your repository so that your job can access it.
  - `run`: Runs a shell command. You can run multiple lines by using `|`.
Common events:
- `push`: Triggered on push.
- `pull_request`: Triggered on pull request activity.
- `schedule`: Triggered on a schedule (cron syntax).
Example: Workflow that runs on push and pull request to the main branch:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
```
Example: Workflow that runs every day at 5:30 UTC:
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 5 * * *'
```
You can also set up jobs to run in a specific order using `needs`:
```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job 1"
  job2:
    needs: job1 # Job2 will run only after job1 completes
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job 2"
```
GitHub Actions also provides a rich set of features like:
- Environment variables
- Secrets management (for sensitive data)
- Matrix builds (to test across multiple versions)
- Caching dependencies
- Artifacts (to save files from a job)
Example: Using environment variables and secrets:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Greet
    run: echo "Hello $FIRST_NAME $LAST_NAME"
    env:
      FIRST_NAME: Mona
      LAST_NAME: ${{ secrets.LAST_NAME }} # Secret stored in the repository settings
```
To get started, you can create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository and add a YAML file. GitHub will automatically pick it up and run the workflow on the specified events.

GitHub Actions Workflow Explained
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform that automates your software workflows directly in your GitHub repository. Here's a breakdown of its core components:

1. Workflow File Structure
Workflows are defined as YAML files in .github/workflows/ directory. Example main.yml:

yaml
name: CI Pipeline  # Workflow name

# When to trigger
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# Jobs to execute
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Runner environment
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Official action to fetch repo
      
    - name: Setup Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest
      
    - name: Notify Slack
      if: failure()  # Conditional execution
      uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1
      with:
        slack-message: "Tests failed!"
2. Key Components
Triggers (on):

Events: push, pull_request, schedule, workflow_dispatch

Branch/tag filters: branches: [main]

Path filters: paths: ['src/**']

Jobs (jobs):

Independent units that run in parallel by default

Example jobs: build, test, deploy

Runner OS: ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest

Steps (steps):

Sequential operations within a job

Can run commands (run) or reuse actions (uses)

Environment variables: env: { VAR: value }

Actions (uses):

Reusable packages: actions/checkout@v4

Marketplace actions: docker/build-push-action@v4

3. Core Concepts
Concept	Description
Runner	Virtual machine (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted) that executes jobs
Artifacts	Files saved between jobs (e.g., build outputs)
Secrets	Encrypted environment variables (store API keys)
Matrix	Parallel job executions with different configurations (e.g., Python versions)
Caching	Cache dependencies (e.g., npm packages) to speed up workflows
4. Real-World Example
yaml
name: Docker Build & Push

on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']  # Trigger on version tags

jobs:
  build-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Docker Login
      uses: docker/login-action@v2
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USER }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

    - name: Build and Push
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
      with:
        context: .
        push: true
        tags: user/app:${{ github.ref_name }}  # Use tag version
5. Advanced Features
Environments: Approval gates for production

Reusable Workflows: Call another workflow like a function

Scheduled Jobs: Cron syntax (0 2 * * * for daily 2AM)

Self-hosted Runners: Custom hardware/OS requirements

Status Badges: Show build status in README

7. Best Practices
Fail Fast: Add linting/validation early in pipeline

Matrix Testing: Test across OS/runtime versions

Cache Dependencies: Use actions/cache

Limit Permissions: Use permissions: key

Clean Up: Add step to remove temporary files

Notifications: Slack/email alerts on failure
